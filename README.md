# The Chinchilla Game
They're fluffy. They're full of energy, and in this console game, chinchilla's are ready for battle! Narwahls, okapis, and marmosets complete the team fighting to protect their fuzzy friend, and each brings its own skill set to the board.
## Player Moves
* Narwhals: Can jump exactly 2 spaces diagonally or one space up, down, left, or right. Since they jump, this means they can jump diagonally over another piece.
* Okapis: Can move exactly one space in any direction. They're slow, but nothing short of capture will stop them.
* Marmosets: Can move up to 4 spaces diagonally and one space in any other direction. This means they can move farther than any other piece, but they can't go over or around other pieces, so the path to their destination must be clear.
* Chinchillas: Can move up to 3 spaces up, down, left, or right or one space diagonally. Like marmosets, the path to their destination must be clear, no going over or around other pieces.
To capture an opponent's piece, simply make a legal move that lands you on a space with your opponent's piece. Capture their chinchilla, and you win!
